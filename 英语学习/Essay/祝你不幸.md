![[我祝你不幸，大法官反鸡汤祝福引人深思 - 1.我祝你不幸，大法官反鸡汤祝福引人深思(Av923390610,P1).mp3]]
From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal, because that will tecah you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time, so that you don't [[take sth for granted|take friends for granted]]. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time, so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life, and understand that your success is not completely deserved, and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope [[every now and then]], your opponent will [[gloat]] over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of [[sportsmanship]]. I hope you'll be ignored, so you know the importance of listening to others. 
我希望在未来的岁月中，你们能时不时地遭遇不公，唯有如此才能懂得公正的价值。我希望你们尝到背叛的滋味，这样才能领悟到忠诚的重要性。抱歉，我还希望你们时常感到孤独，唯有如此你们才不会视朋友为理所当然。我祝你们偶尔运气不佳，这样你们才会意识到机遇在人生中扮演的角色，从而明白你的成功并非天经地义，而他人的失败也不是命中注定。当你偶尔失败时，我愿你的对手时不时地会幸灾乐祸，这样你才能懂得互相尊重的竞技精神的重要性。我希望你被人无视，唯有如此你才懂得倾听他人有多重要。

Thank you!
I am [[honor|honored]] to be with you today at your [[commencement]] from one of the [[finest]] universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever [[get to|gotten to]] a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.  
<small>我很荣幸今天和你们，来自世界最顶尖大学之一的学生们，一起参加毕业典礼。老实说，我没从大学毕业，这是我一生中离大学毕业最近的一次。今天，我想向你们讲述我生命中的三个故事，并非什么了不得的大事件，只是三个小故事而已。</small>
![[乔布斯first.MP3]]
The first story is about connecting the [[dot|dots]].
<small>第一个故事是关于，如何把生命中的点点滴滴串连起来。</small>

I [[drop out|dropped out]] of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a [[drop-in]] for another 18 months [[or so]] before I really quit. So why did I [[drop out]]? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to [[put sb up for adoption|put me up for adoption]]. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all [[set for]] me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
<small>我在里德大学只读了6个月就退学了，但之后仍作为旁听生呆了18个月后，才最终离开。那么我为什么要退学呢？那要从我出生前说起。我的生母是一位年轻的未婚大学毕业生，她决定让别人收养我。她坚定地认为我应该被大学毕业生收养，所以在我出生时，她已经做好了一切安排，让我被一个律师和他的妻子收养。</small>

Except, when I [[pop out|popped out ]] they decided at the last minuter that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him ?" They said : "Of course. " My biological mother later [[find out|found out]] that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption [[papers]]. She only [[relent|relented]] a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was a start in my life.
<small>出人意料的是，在我出生时，律师夫妇在最后一刻突然决定他们其实想要一个女孩。所以我的养父母(他们还在我亲生父母的观察名单上)突然在半夜接到了一个电话:“我们这意外多出一个男婴,你们想要他吗？” 他们回答道:“当然!” 但是我生母随后得知，我的养母大学没毕业，养父连高中都没有毕业。她拒绝在收养文件上签字。几个月以后,当我的父母承诺一定会送我上大学的时,她才勉强同意。这是我人生的开始。</small>

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I [[naively]] chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my [[working-class]] parents' savings were being spent on my college [[tuition]]. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me [[figure out|figure it out]]. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to [[drop out]] and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. 
<small>17年之后,我真的上了大学。但是我很天真地选择了一所几乎和斯坦福大学一样贵的学校, 我工人阶级的父母，他们把所有积蓄都花在了我的学费上面。在六个月后, 我已经看不到上学的价值。我不知道我想要做什么,我也不知道大学如何能帮解决这个问题。而我在这里上学，几乎花光了父母一辈子的积蓄。所以我决定退学,并且相信一切都会好起来的。当时我十分害怕, 但是现在看来，那是我做过最正确的决定之一。</small>

The minuter I dropped out I could stop [[take the required classes|taking the required classes]] that didn't interest me, and begin [[drop-in|dropping in]] on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a [[dorm]] room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 [[cent|cents]] [[deposit|deposits]] to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna [[temple]]. I loved it. And much of what I [[stumbled into|stumbled into]] by following my curiosity and intuition [[turn out|turned out]] to be priceless later on. 
<small>我退学的那一刻起, 就再也不用上毫无兴趣的必修课，然后我开始去旁听那些看起来有趣的课程。但是事情并没有想象的那样容易。我失去了我的宿舍,所以我只能睡在朋友宿舍的地板上,我去捡5美分的可乐瓶子，仅仅为了填饱肚子, 每周日晚上,我需要走七英里的路程，穿过小镇，只为能在Krishna教堂吃顿像样在饭菜。但是我乐此不疲。这些跟随好奇心和直觉所做的事情,后来都被证明是无价之宝</small>

Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best [[calligraphy]] [[instruction]] in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every [[drawer]], was beautifully [[hand-calligraphed]]. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a [[calligraphy]] class to learn how to do this. I learned about [[serif]] and san serif [[typeface|typefaces]], about varying the [[amount of]] space between different [[letter]] [[combination|combinations]], about what makes great [[typography]] great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically [[subtle]] in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating. 
<small>我给你们举个例子：那时的里德大学拥有也许是全美最好的书法教学。校园里的每一幅海报, 每一个抽屉的标签都是漂亮的手写体。因为我退学了不必去上常规课程，所以我决定去学一门书法课，学习怎么写出这样的字体。我学到了衬线和无衬线字体, 英文字母组合的间距规则, 学到了是什么让这些印刷体变得如此美丽。那种美感，给人的历史感和艺术享受是科学无法捕捉到的，我被完全吸引了。</small>

None of this had even a hope of any [[practical application]] in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first [[Macintosh]] computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful [[typography]]. If I had never dropped in on that [[single]] course in college, the Mac would have never had [[multiple]] [[typeface|typefaces]] or [[proportionally]] spaced [[font#font|fonts]]. 
<small>当时看来这些东西好像对我的人生来说没有任何实用价值。但是十年之后，当我们设计第一台苹果电脑的时候，它一下子浮现了出来。我们将这些东西全部设计进了我们的电脑。于是漂亮的印刷体第一次出现在电脑上。如果我当年没有旁听这一门课，苹果就不会有如此丰富的字体以及漂亮的字间距。</small>

And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never [[drop out|dropped out]], I would have never [[drop-in|dropped in]] on this [[calligraphy]] class, and personal computers might not have wonderful [[typography]] that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots [[look forward|looking forward]] when I was in college. But it was very, very clear [[look backwards|looking backwards]] ten years later. 
<small>鉴于微软只知道抄袭苹果，估计没有个人电脑会有这些。如果我没有退学，没有旁听这门书法课，也许所有电脑都不会有如此美丽的印刷体。当然，在大学的时候我不可能预见到它们之间的联系。但十年后回首往事，一切都非常明了。</small>

Again, you can't connect the dots [[look forward|looking forward]]; you can only connect them [[look backwards|looking backwards]]. So you have to trust that the dots will [[somehow]] connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your [[gut]], destiny, life, [[karma]], whatever. Because believing the dots will connect [[down the road]], will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it lead you [[off the well-worn path]]. And that will make all the difference. 
<small>同样，你们也无法预知未来；只有回头看时才会发现它们的关系。所以你必须相信，你现在获得的点滴会在未来连结起来。你必须相信一些东西——直觉，命运，人生，因果，无论什么都可以。因为如果你相信这些点滴会连接起你未来的道路，你就会拥有跟随自己内心的自信，即使它会让你偏离主流，但这将使一切都变得不一样。</small>
![[乔布斯second.MP3]]
My second story is about love and loss.
<small>我的第二个故事是关于爱与失去。</small>

I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents [[garage]] when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just [[release]] our [[finest]] creation - the [[Macintosh]] - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. 
<small>我很幸运——在很早的时候就找到了喜欢做的事情。20岁的时候，沃茨和我在车库里面开创了苹果公司。我们努力工作，用了仅仅10年时间，苹果就从两个穷小子发展成超过4000人，价值20亿的公司。那个时候，我们最棒的产品——Macintosh——刚刚发布一年，而我刚刚30岁。</small>

And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we [[hire|hired]] [[someone]] who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our [[vision|visions]] of the future began to [[diverge]] and eventually we had a [[fall out|falling out]]. When we did, our [[Board of Directors]] [[side|sided]] with him. So at 30 I was out, And very [[public#publicly|publicly]] out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it [[devastate|devastating]]. 
<small>这时，我被解雇了。你怎么可能被自己创立的公司解雇呢？在苹果快速成长的时候，我们请了一个我当时认为很有才能的家伙和我一起运营公司，第一年，一切顺利。但后来我们对未来的看法发生了分歧，最终我们吵翻了。而这时，董事会在了他那边。所以，在30岁时，我在众目睽睽下被开除了。我整个成年生活的重心突然丢失了，这是个致命的打击。</small>

I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the [[previous]] [[generation]] of [[entrepreneur|entrepreneurs]] down - that I had [[drop|dropped]] the [[baton]] as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for [[screw up|screwing up]] so badly. I was a very [[public ]]failure, and I even thought about running away from the [[valley]]. But something slowly began to [[dawn on]] me - I still loved what I did. [[The turn of]] events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to [[start over]].
<small>有几个月的时间，我不知所措。我感到自己让上一代的创业者们失望了——我弄丢了他们传给我的接力棒。我跟David Packard 和 Bob Noyce 见面，试图为我的糟糕表现向他们道歉。我变成了人尽皆知的失败者，我甚至想逃离硅谷。但我渐渐明白了一件事——那就是我仍然爱着我所从事的行业。在苹果的失败，丝毫没有改变这一点。虽然被赶走了，但是我的爱还在。于是我决定从头再来。</small>

I didn't see it then, but it [[turned out]] that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The [[heavy|heaviness]] of being successful was replaced by the [[light|lighting]] of being a [[begin|beginner]] again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. 
<small>我当时没有觉察，但是事后证明，离开苹果是我这辈子发生的最好的事情。成功的沉重被重新出发的轻盈所代替，我不再执迷于任何事情。这让我变得自由，并进入了人生中最富创造力的时期。在接下来的5年里，我创立了一家名叫NeXT的公司，和另一家叫皮克斯的公司，与一位美丽的女人恋爱，她后来成为了我的妻子。</small>

Pixar [[go on to|went on to]] create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful [[animation studio]] in the world. In a [[remarkable]] [[The turn of|turn of]] events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to apple, and the technology we developed at NEXT is at the heart of Apple's [[current]] [[renaissance]]. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. 
<small>皮克斯制作了世界上第一个全电脑制作的动画电影《玩具总动员》，如今已经是世界上最知名的动画工作室。后来阴差阳错，苹果收购了NeXT，我重新回到了苹果公司，而我们在NeXT开发的技术是苹果当前得以复兴的核心，Lorene也跟我一起组建了幸福的家庭。</small>

I'm [[pretty|pretty sure]] none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. [[It was awful tasting medicine]], but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
<small>我很确定，如果不被苹果开除，所有的这一切都不会发生。良药苦口，但我想这正是我需要的。有时候生活会给你当头一棒，不要失去信心。唯一支撑我继续走下去的，是我爱我所做的事。你必须找到你忠爱的东西，对工作如此，对爱人亦然。</small>

Your work is going to [[fill a large part of]] your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it [[yet]], keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great [[relationship]], it just gets better and better as the [[year|years]] [[roll on]]. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.
<small>你的工作将占据你生命中很大的一部分，只有相信自己所做的是伟大的工作，你才能活得快乐。而伟大的工作就源自你的爱，如果你还没有找到，继续寻找，不要停下脚步。全心全意的寻找，当你遇到它时，你就会明白，就像那些美好的爱情，它会随着岁月的流逝愈加醇美。所以继续寻找，不要停下脚步。</small>
![[乔布斯third.MP3]]
My third story is about death.
<small>我的第三个故事是关于死亡。</small>

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, [[someday]] you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today ?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days [[in a row]], I know I need to change something. 
<small>我17岁的时候，读到过一句话：“如果你把每一天当作是生命的最后一天，总有一天你会是对的”，这话给我留下了深刻的印象。在那之后的33年里，每天早晨我都对着镜子问自己：“如果今天是我生命中的最后一天，我不会做我今天要做的这些事吗？”，如果连续很多天的答案都是“不”，我就知道需要改变了。</small>

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever [[encounter|encountered]] to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of [[embarrassment]] or failure - these things just [[fall away]] in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already [[nake|naked]]. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
<small>记住自己终将会死去是我重要的自我检验，并帮助我做出了许多人生中的重要决定。因为几乎任何事——所有的期望、所有的荣耀、对失败的恐惧，一切都会在死亡面前淡去，只留下真正重要的东西。时刻提醒自己终将会死去，便可以帮助你避开担心失去身外之物的恐惧。你本就一无所有，没有理由不去追随你的内心。</small>

About a year ago I was [[diagnose|diagnosed]] with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a [[tumor]] on my [[pancreas]]. I didn't even know what a [[pancreas]] was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is [[curable|incurable]], and that I should [[expect]] to live no longer than three to six months.
<small>大约一年前，我被诊断出患有癌症。我在早晨七点半做了一次扫描，清楚显示出我的胰腺里有个肿瘤。我之前连胰腺是什么都不知道。医生告诉我胰腺癌基本上无法治愈，我可能只剩下三到六个月的时间。</small>

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's [[code]] for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure [[everything is buttoned up]] so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. 
<small>医生让我回家安排一下自己的事情，这是医生对所有临终病人的话。这意味着对于你的孩子们，你要把未来十年的话在几个月里说完；意味着做好所有的准备，让你的家人尽可能的轻松一些；意味着跟所有人说再见。</small>

I lived with that [[diagnosis]] all day. Later that evening I had a [[biopsy]], where they stuck an [[endoscope]] down my throat, through my [[stomach]] and into my [[intestines]], put a [[needle]] into my [[pancreas]] and got a few cells from the [[tumor]]. I was [[sedate|sedated]], but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctors started crying because it [[turned out]] to be a very rare form of [[pancreas#pancreatic|pancreatic]] cancer that is [[curable]] with [[surgery]]. I had the [[surgery]] and I'm fine now. 
<small>我一整天都在想着这个诊断。那天傍晚，我做了一个活体检查，医生将一个内窥镜伸进喉咙，通过我的胃进入肠道，用一根针在我的肿瘤上取了一些细胞。我当时是被麻醉的，但妻子告诉我：当医生在显微镜下观察细胞的时候，他们喜极而泣。原来这是一种非常罕见的，可以通过手术治愈的癌症。我接受了这个手术，现在我痊愈了。</small>

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. 
<small>这是我最接近死亡的时刻，希望这也是未来几十年里最近的一次。与死神擦肩而过，让我更加确信一点：没有人愿意死，因为对我来说死亡不再只是一个抽象的概念。就算那些想上天堂的人也不想为此去死。</small>

And yet death is the [[destiny#destination|destination]] we all [[share]]. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change [[agent]]. [[It clears out the old to make way for the new]]. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. 
<small>但是死亡是每个人共同的终点，从来没有人能逃脱它，因为死亡就是生命最好的发明，是生命更迭的动力。它去除老旧，拥抱新生。现在，你们就是新生的力量，但是用不了多久，你们会变成老旧，然后被渐渐清除掉。</small>

Sorry to be so [[dramatic]], but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by [[dogma]] - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions [[drown out]] your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They [[somehow]] already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
<small>抱歉说得夸张了点，但这都是事实。光阴如梭，所以不要浪费时间过你不想要的生活。不要被教条束缚，那意味着按照别人的想法生活；不要被世人的喧嚣掩盖了你的心声。还有最重要的是，要有跟随你的内心和直觉的勇气，它们知道你想做一个什么样的人，其他的一切都是次要的。</small>

When I was young, there was an amazing [[public#publication|publication]] called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the [[bible|bibles]] of my [[generation]]. It was created by a [[fellow]] named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his [[poetic]] [[touch]]. 
<small>当我年轻的时候，有一本非常棒的杂志叫《全球概览》，它是我们那一代人的圣经之一。它的创办人叫Stewart Brand，就住在离这不远的Menlo Park，他以艺术般的手法为刊物注入了生命。</small>
 
This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and [[desktop]] publishing, so it was all made with [[typewriter|typewriters]], [[scissor|scissors]], and [[polaroid]] cameras. It was [[sort of]] like Google in [[paperback]] form, 35 years before Google came along: it was [[idealistic]], and [[overflow|overflowing]] with neat tools and great notions. 
<small>那是60年代末，在个人电脑和台式机出现以前是用打字机。所以这本书完全是用打字机，剪刀还有老相机制作的。它就像书籍版的Google，在Google出现的35年之前，它充斥着理想的色彩，简洁的工具和伟大的想法。</small>
 
Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning county road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. 
<small>Stewart和他的团队出版了几期的《全球概览》，当它完成了自己使命的时候，他们出版了最后的一期。那是70年代中期，我正是你们现在的年纪。最后一期的封底上是一幅清晨乡村公路的照片，是那种你去搭便车旅行就会看到的景色。</small>
 
Beneath it were the words: " [[Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.]]" It was their [[farewell]] message as they [[sign off|signed off]]. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin [[anew]], I wish that for you.
<small>照片下面有一句话：“求知若渴，虚心若愚。”，这是他们停刊的别语。“求知若渴，虚心若愚。”，我总是以此自勉。在你们即将毕业开始崭新的旅程之时，我将这句话也赠予你们。</small>

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
Thank you all very much.
